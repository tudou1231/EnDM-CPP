Cell-Penetrating Peptide (CPP) is a key carrier for drug delivery. Since the process of synthesizing new CPPs in the laboratory is both time- and resource-consuming, computational methods to predict potential CPPs can associate to find CPP to enhance the development of CPPs in therapy. In this study, EnDM-CPP is proposed, which combines machine learning algorithms (SVM and CatBoost) with convolutional neural networks (CNN and TextCNN). For dataset construction, three previous CPP benchmark datasets including CPPsite 2.0, MLCPP 2.0 and CPP924 are merged to improve the diversity and reduce homology. For feature generation, two language model-based features obtained from the Transformer architecture including ProtT5 and ESM-2 are employed into CNN and TextCNN. Additionally, sequence features, such as CPRS, Hyrid PseAAC, KSC, etc., are input to SVM and CatBoost. Based on result of each predictor, Logistic Regression(LR) is built to predict the final decision. The experiment results indicate ProtT5 and ESM-2 fusion features show a significant contribution to predict CPP and the combination of employed features and models demonstrate better association. On an independent test dataset comparison, EnDM-CPP achieved an accuracy of 0.9495 and a Mathews correlation coefficient of 0.9008 with improvement of 2% to 5% and 2% to 5% respectively compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
